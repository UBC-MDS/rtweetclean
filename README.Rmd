# rtweetclean

rtweetclean is a R package built to act as a processor of data generated by the existing [rtweet package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rtweet/versions/0.4.0) that can produce clean data frames, summarize data, and generate new features.

Our package aims to add additional resources for users of the already existing rtweet package. rtweet is a package built around Twitter's API and is used to scrape tweet information from their servers. Our package creates functionality which enables users to process the raw data from rtweet into a more understandable format by extracting and organizing the contents of tweets for a user. rtweet is specifically built to be used in analysis of a specific user's timeline (generated using tweepy's api.user\_timeline function). Users can easily visualize average engagement based on time of day posted, see basic summary statistics of word contents and sentiment analysis of tweets and have a processed dataset that can be used in a wide variety of machine learning models.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {.r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/rtweetclean")
```


## Functions

- `clean_df(raw_tweets_df, handle = "", text_only = TRUE, word_count = TRUE, emojis = TRUE, hashtags = TRUE, sentiment = TRUE, flesch_readability = TRUE, proportion_of_avg_retweets = TRUE, proportion_of_avg_favorites = TRUE)`: Cleans up and creates new feature columns to the dataframe obtained by using the tweepy package, including: a link/hashtag/emoji free version of the text column, a wordcount, a sentimentality score, a flesch readability score, a user entered handle, a column containing all emojis used, and a column containing all hashtags used.

- `tweet_words(clean_tweets_df)`: Generates a list of the most frequently used words by the twitter user. Uses the dataframe created by  the `clean_df()` function as an input.

- `sentiment_total(clean_tweets_df)`: Returns a summary count of the number of words that are associated with a list of emotions/sentiments. Uses the `text_only` column of the dataframe created by the `clean_df()` function as an input.

- `engagement_by_hour(clean_tweets_df)`: Plots a line chart showing popular times of the day to tweet for the user, by displaying average engagement (favorites + retweets) received by hour of day. Uses the dataframe created by the `clean_df()` function as an input.

## Usage & Examples

Below function calls are based on below example dataframe:

```{r toy_dataset, echo=TRUE}
library(rtweetclean)
created_at  = c("2021-03-06 16:03:31",
                "2021-03-05 21:57:47",
                '2021-03-05 05:50:50',
                '2021-03-05 7:32:33')
text <- c("example tweet text 1 @user2 @user",
          "#example #tweet 2 ",
          "example tweet 3 https://t.co/G4ziCaPond",
          "example tweet 4")
retweet_count <- c(43, 12, 24, 29)
favorite_count <- c(85, 41, 65, 54)
timeline_rtweet_toy <- data.frame(text, retweet_count, favorite_count, created_at)
timeline_rtweet_toy
```

Function calls in action:


```{r clean_df}
cleaned_timeline <- clean_df(timeline_rtweet_toy)
cleaned_timeline
```


```{r tweet_words}
tweet_words(cleaned_timeline, top_n=3)
```


```{r sentiment_total}
sentiment_total(cleaned_timeline, drop_sentiment = FALSE)
```

```{r engagement_by_hour, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
engagement_by_hour(cleaned_timeline)
```

## rtweetclean in the R ecosystem

rtweetclean provides additional functionality to the existing rtweet package by generating commonly desired data features relevant with twitter API data. This is combined with streamlined summary statistics methods that can quickly and effortlessly produce figures and tables of various different factors in your rtweet data. This allows users to easily understand and analyze information about a twitter user's timeline. Specifically, examining an accounts engagement, most common words, and emotional sentiment can each be done with the various functions in the package.
