# rtweetclean

rtweetclean is a R package built to act as a processor of data generated by the existing [rtweet package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rtweet/versions/0.4.0) that can produce clean data frames, summarize data, and generate new features.

Our package aims to add additional resources for users of the already existing rtweet package. rtweet is a package built around Twitter's API and is used to scrape tweet information from their servers. Our package creates functionality which enables users to process the raw data from rtweet into a more understandable format by extracting and organizing the contents of tweets for a user. rtweet is specifically built to be used in analysis of a specific user's timeline (generated using tweepy's api.user\_timeline function). Users can easily visualize average engagement based on time of day posted, see basic summary statistics of word contents and sentiment analysis of tweets and have a processed dataset that can be used in a wide variety of machine learning models.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/rtweetclean")
```

## Features

Functions capabilities:

- `clean_df()`: The ability to add new feature columns to the dataframe obtained by using the tweepy package, including: a link/hashtag/emoji free version of the text column, a wordcount, a sentimentality score, a flesch readability score, a user entered handle, a column containing all emojis used, and a column containing all hashtags used.

- `engagement_by_hour()`: generates a line chart using the dataframe generated after using the clean_tweets() function. Shows favorites/retweets received by hour in the dataframe.

- `tweet_words()`: generates a list from the clean_tweets() dataframe (needs the text_only column generated by clean_tweets()) of the most frequently used words by the twitter users timeline.

- `sentiment_total()`: takes a vector of tweets and returns a summary count of the number of words that are associated with a list of emotions/sentiments (requires inputting only the text_only column of the dataframe generated by clean_tweets()).

## Usage

**Functions**

`clean_df(raw_tweets_df, handle = "", text_only = TRUE, word_count = TRUE, emojis = TRUE, hashtags = TRUE, sentiment = TRUE, flesch_readability = TRUE, proportion_of_avg_retweets = TRUE, proportion_of_avg_favorites = TRUE)`: Creates new columns based on the data in the dataframe generated by raw\_df() and returns a new dataframe. Can generate the following columns.

-   handle: Adds a column containing the a specified twitter handle.

-   text\_only: Adds a column of the tweet text containing no emojis, links, hashtags, or mentions.

-   emojis: Adds a column of the extracted emojis from tweet text and places them in their own column

-   hashtags: Add a column of the extracted hashtags from tweet text

-   sentiment: add a column containing the nltk.sentiment.vader SentimentIntensityAnalyzer sentiment score for each tweet

-   flesch\_readability: Adds a column containing the textstat flesch readability score (default is TRUE)

-   media\_links: Adds a column containing links to photo or video attached to a tweet

-   proportion\_of\_avg\_retweets: Adds a column containing a proportion value of how many retweets a tweet received compared to the account average.

-   proportion\_of\_avg\_hearts: Adds a column containing a proportion value of how many hearts a tweet received compared to the account average

`engagement_by_hour(tweets_df)` : Creates an ggplot line chart of average number of likes and retweets received by hour of tweet posted.

`tweet_words(clean_dataframe, top_n=1)` : Returns a dataframe of the most common words and counts from a list of tweets.

`sentiment_total(tweets, drop_sentiment = FALSE)`: Takes a list of tweets and summarizes the number of tweeted words associated with particular emotional sentiments. Returns a dataframe.

## rtweetclean Place in the R Ecosystem

rtweetclean provides additional functionality to the existing rtweet package by generating commonly desired data features relevant with twitter API data. This is combined with streamlined summary statistics methods that can quickly and effortlessly produce figures and tables of various different factors in your rtweet data. This allows users to easily understand and analyze information about a twitter user's timeline. Specifically, examining an accounts engagement, most common words, and emotional sentiment can each be done with a single function.
