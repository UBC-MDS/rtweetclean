# rtweetclean

rtweetclean is a R package built to act as a processor of data generated
by the existing [rtweet
package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rtweet/versions/0.4.0)
that can produce clean data frames, summarize data, and generate new
features.

Our package aims to add additional resources for users of the already
existing rtweet package. rtweet is a package built around Twitter’s API
and is used to scrape tweet information from their servers. Our package
creates functionality which enables users to process the raw data from
rtweet into a more understandable format by extracting and organizing
the contents of tweets for a user. rtweet is specifically built to be
used in analysis of a specific user’s timeline (generated using tweepy’s
api.user\_timeline function). Users can easily visualize average
engagement based on time of day posted, see basic summary statistics of
word contents and sentiment analysis of tweets and have a processed
dataset that can be used in a wide variety of machine learning models.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/rtweetclean")
```

## Features

Functions capabilities:

  - `clean_df()`: The ability to add new feature columns to the
    dataframe obtained by using the tweepy package, including: a
    link/hashtag/emoji free version of the text column, a wordcount, a
    sentimentality score, a flesch readability score, a user entered
    handle, a column containing all emojis used, and a column containing
    all hashtags used.

  - `engagement_by_hour()`: generates a line chart using the dataframe
    generated after using the clean\_df() function. Shows
    favorites/retweets received by hour in the dataframe.

  - `tweet_words()`: generates a list from the clean\_df() dataframe
    (needs the text\_only column generated by clean\_df()) of the most
    frequently used words by the twitter users timeline.

  - `sentiment_total()`: takes a vector of tweets and returns a summary
    count of the number of words that are associated with a list of
    emotions/sentiments (requires inputting only the text\_only column
    of the dataframe generated by clean\_df()).

## Usage

**Functions**

`clean_df(raw_tweets_df, handle = "", text_only = TRUE, word_count =
TRUE, emojis = TRUE, hashtags = TRUE, sentiment = TRUE,
flesch_readability = TRUE, proportion_of_avg_retweets = TRUE,
proportion_of_avg_favorites = TRUE)`: Creates new columns based on the
data in the dataframe generated by raw\_df() and returns a new
dataframe. Can generate the following columns.

  - handle: Adds a column containing the a specified twitter handle.

  - text\_only: Adds a column of the tweet text containing no emojis,
    links, hashtags, or mentions.

  - emojis: Adds a column of the extracted emojis from tweet text and
    places them in their own column

  - hashtags: Add a column of the extracted hashtags from tweet text

  - sentiment: add a column containing the nltk.sentiment.vader
    SentimentIntensityAnalyzer sentiment score for each tweet

  - flesch\_readability: Adds a column containing the textstat flesch
    readability score (default is TRUE)

  - media\_links: Adds a column containing links to photo or video
    attached to a tweet

  - proportion\_of\_avg\_retweets: Adds a column containing a proportion
    value of how many retweets a tweet received compared to the account
    average.

  - proportion\_of\_avg\_hearts: Adds a column containing a proportion
    value of how many hearts a tweet received compared to the account
    average

`engagement_by_hour(tweets_df)` : Creates an ggplot line chart of
average number of likes and retweets received by hour of tweet posted.

`tweet_words(clean_dataframe, top_n=1)` : Returns a dataframe of the
most common words and counts from a list of tweets.

`sentiment_total(tweets, drop_sentiment = FALSE)`: Takes a list of
tweets and summarizes the number of tweeted words associated with
particular emotional sentiments. Returns a dataframe.

## rtweetclean Place in the R Ecosystem

rtweetclean provides additional functionality to the existing rtweet
package by generating commonly desired data features relevant with
twitter API data. This is combined with streamlined summary statistics
methods that can quickly and effortlessly produce figures and tables of
various different factors in your rtweet data. This allows users to
easily understand and analyze information about a twitter user’s
timeline. Specifically, examining an accounts engagement, most common
words, and emotional sentiment can each be done with a single function.
